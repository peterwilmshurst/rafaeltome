                    <p>Working with clients on challenging projects is always demanding but also very rewarding, no matter the experience you have dealing with the situation it always requires the best of you to accomplish great results. But when it comes to you as your own client, things get even more complicated, not only because you are a designer and a creative leader but also because it’s your big day and everything has to be perfect, not just for your fiancé but for you… yeah, it’s like you are the princess and you want the perfection in every single bit.</p>

                    <p>Although you can never get that, because there will always be something going wrong despite your efforts, and it’s fine, don’t worry… at the end of the day you will always have the feeling it was magic and even the issues during the day will be something nice to remember.</p>
                    <p>Feeling and magic apart, the project, how was it? What where the challenges? What were the accomplishments? What was the process? All good questions to be asked… I think all those questions get answered by the photos and the video…</p>

                    <p>As you can never achieve greatness all by yourself, this one is not an exception. Great creative direction doesn’t work if not with the proper support, tools and people, and for that I am very glad. Great team work with wife and family, great understanding of the decoration team that kindly understood our requirements and concept and great photography work that we gladly directed and coordinated through together.</p>
