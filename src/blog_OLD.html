            <h2>The most challenging project of my life</h2>
            <p>Working with clients on challenging projects is always demanding but also very rewarding, no matter the
                experience you have dealing with the situation it always requires the best of you to accomplish great
                results. But when it comes to you as your own client, things get even more complicated, not only
                because you are a designer and a creative leader but also because it’s your big day and everything has to be
                perfect, not just for your fiancé but for you… yeah, it’s like you are the princess and you want the
                perfection in every single bit.</p>

            <h2>The Creative Process</h2>
            <p>Do you ever struggle with thinking of an idea? Me too, all the time. Here’s how I overcome that creative
                block. In this video, I take you on a journey inside of my head. All the while I narrate my thinking
                and decision making process as I make an illustration using Procreate on my iPad. There are time
                lapses, reference sources, very cute dogs and personal stories about where I look for inspiration.</p>
