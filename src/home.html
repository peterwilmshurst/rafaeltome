            Besides being a great professional, he tries his best to promote a good and joyful working environment for all his colleagues. When it comes up to dominating the main designer softwares like adobe ilustrator and photoshop, don’t try to compete with him because you’ll most likely lose! Here at Auratus we all miss him and wish him the best!”</p><br />
