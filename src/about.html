                    <p><strong>On a mission to help organisations deliver best in class customer experience through brands, services and products to therefore create meaningful human impact and eventually make people’s lives better.</strong> Rafa is currently the User Experience guru and the Digital Experiences Lead Designer at Domtar where he has been helping multiple owned and partner brands mature and implement innovative methodologies through multiple channels and media.</p>
                    <p>Rafael’s studies at University of Arts of London have equipped him with a specialization in Creative Direction. Previously, Rafa graduated with a specialization in Design from the University of Aveiro, Portugal and also attended Galileu’s Professional Training School specializing in web and mobile development. Staying actively involved in the community is very important to him, and he has been involved in organizing several charity and benefit events.</p>
                    <p>In 2019, Rafa was rewarded a Star Award for his outstanding job supporting a global product launch campaign. He has also launched a global technical book at Domtar called “The Digital UI/UX Style Guidelines and components” in partnership with his colleague Peter Wilmshurst, setting this way the digital standards for User Experiences and Interactions for the organization. A Digital Product Guide book was also developed and published by Rafael and his colleague Joel Williams, which set the flagship for best practices for digital product’s customer experience standards.</p>
